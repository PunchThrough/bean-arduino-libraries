# Bean Arduino Libraries

This repo contains the libraries that are included with the Bean Cloud Compiler. In addition to these libraries, some are included (and usually modified) in the [Bean Arduino Core](https://github.com/PunchThrough/bean-arduino-core) directly.

The following should work in any sketch:

```c
#include <Adafruit_MCP9808.h>
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>
#include <NewPing.h>
#include <SFE_MicroOLED.h>
#include <SoftPWM.h>
#include <SparkFunISL29125.h>
#include <Grove_LED_Bar.h>
```
